# AutoHotKey Script Formatter

## Overview

This AutoHotKey script allows you to quickly format your AutoHotKey code and copy it to the clipboard. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for pasting AutoHotKey code, formatting it, and copying the formatted code to the clipboard. Additionally, it supports keyboard shortcuts for a more seamless experience.

## How to Use

Run `Get formated code.ahk`

### Using the GUI

1. **Paste AutoHotKey Code for Formatting:**
   - Use (Ctrl+V) to paste your AutoHotKey code into the provided text area.

2. **Format Code:**
   - Click the "Format Code" button or use the shortcut (Alt+Ctrl+Shift+F).
   - The formatted AutoHotKey code will be displayed in the adjacent text area.

3. **Copy to Clipboard:**
   - Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button or use the shortcut (Alt+Ctrl+Shift+C).
   - If the AutoHotKey code is already formatted and not in the clipboard, it will be copied.

4. **Exiting the Application:**
   - Click the close button on the GUI or use the shortcut (Alt+L) to exit the application.

### Using Keyboard Shortcuts
